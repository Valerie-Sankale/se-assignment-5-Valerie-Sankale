   Debugging Configuration: 
      Customize how your application is launched and debugged by editing launch.json, specifying runtime options, environment variables, and more.


10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.


A.Initializing a Repository
      Open VS Code: 
         Launch Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
      Open a Folder: 
         Either open an existing project folder or create a new one where you want to initialize your Git repository.

   Initialize Git Repository:
      Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
      Type and select Git: Initialize Repository.
      Choose the folder you want to initialize as a Git repository.
         Alternatively, you can initialize Git via the Terminal integrated in VS Code:
               Open the Terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+``).
               Navigate to your project directory using cd path/to/your/project.
               Run git init to initialize a Git repository.
   Making Commits
      Stage Changes:
         In VS Code, open the Source Control view by clicking the icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or use Ctrl+Shift+G).
         You'll see a list of files that have been modified. Click the + button next to each file to stage them for commit, or stage all changes using the + button at the top of the changes list.
      Commit Changes:
         After staging your changes, enter a commit message in the text box labeled "Message (press Ctrl+Enter to commit)". Describe the changes briefly and press Ctrl+Enter to commit.
            Alternatively, you can commit via the Terminal:
               Use git add . to stage all changes or specify files individually (git add file1 file2 ...).
                  Then, commit with git commit -m "Your commit message".

B. Pushing Changes to GitHub
To push your changes to GitHub, assuming you already have a repository created on GitHub:

   Add GitHub Remote:
         Obtain the URL of your GitHub repository (e.g., https://github.com/username/repository.git).
         In VS Code, open the Terminal (`Ctrl+``) and add the remote using:
         git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
         Replace the URL with your repository's URL.
   Push Changes:
         After committing your changes, you need to push them to GitHub
         git push -u origin master
         This command pushes your commits from the local master branch to the master branch on GitHub.
         If you're working on a different branch, replace master with your branch name (git push -u origin your_branch).

 Submission Guidelines:
